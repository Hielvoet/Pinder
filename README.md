# Pinder
'Tinder'-like application, but for scientific articles. Specifically made to help with systematic literature reviews. 

## Download instructions (windows*):
Note that the .exe file is saved in the Git LFS (Large File Storage) server. Therefore, download the .exe file seperately from the other files in this repo. Go directly to the .exe file here: https://github.com/Hielvoet/Pinder/blob/main/pinder_Vexe.exe and hit the download button.

If the .exe file does not work properly, try to download it in one-dir mode instead: https://github.com/Hielvoet/Pinder/blob/main/Pinder_exe_file_onedir.zip
Unzip this file after downloading and navigate to: ...\exe_file_onedir\dist\pinder_Vexe. Here you should find the "pinder.exe" file. Double click on it to start Pinder. You can also create a shortcut and store it at a location that is more convenient for you. Create a shortcut by right-clicking on the file and choose "Create shortcut".

More intuitive download options are still in development. 

*Download instructions for other operating systems follow at a later stage.
