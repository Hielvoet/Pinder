critically evaluated in respect of the implications for urban planning,

represents a range of environmental hazards and will affect populations
where the current burden of climate-sensitive disease is high - such as
the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the
current impact of weather and climate variability on the health of urban
populations is the first step towards assessing future impacts. In this
paper, we have reviewed the scientific evidence for the effects of
temperature, rainfall and extreme events on human health, in particular
the impacts of heat waves and floods. The methods for assessing the
risks of climate change are undergoing development, and there is a need
to shift the focus from global and regional to local studies. Sectoral
approaches to climate change impact assessments often ignore the effects
on health. There is a need to better describe the risks to health from
extreme weather events as well as improve the effectiveness of public
health interventions. Improving the resilience of cities to climate
change also requires improvements in the urban infrastructure, but such
improvements may not be achieved quickly enough to avoid an increased
burden of disease due to global climate change.},

 abstract = {Despite continuing efforts to upgrade the urban storm sewer system since
the late 1950s, the City of Shanghai is still vulnerable to persistent
rainstorm waterlogging due to excess surface runoff and sewer surcharge,
which frequently cause significant damage to buildings and disruption to
traffic. Rapid urbanization and associated land cover changes are the
major factors contributing to waterlogging. However, it is unclear to
what extent changes in rainfall variability over the past few decades
are also involved. This paper investigates the combined impacts of land
use and land cover change, storm sewer development, and long-term
variations in precipitation. Evidence of persistent waterlogging is
presented first. We then give an account of land surface modifications
during the process of urbanization and the development of the city's
urban storm sewer system. Statistical analysis suggests that the
increase in runoff coefficient due to conversion of lands from
agricultural to industrial, commercial, and residential uses is a major
factor driving greater waterlogging risk. In particular, historical
analysis of aerial photographs reveals the rate and extent of
modification to river networks in the past few decades. The natural
drainage network has shrunk by 270 km, significantly reducing the city's
capacity to transport excess surface flow. In line with other studies,
we find no significant overall trends in annual rainfall totals (at
Baoshan and Xujiahui). However, seasonal and monthly rainfall
intensities have increased. At the daily scale, we find that compared to
pre-1980s: (i) there has been an increase in the number of wet days with
precipitation exceeding 25 mm (Heavy Rainfall) and decrease in those
below 25 mm and (ii) the number of consecutive wet days with
precipitation maximum and average exceeding the threshold known to cause
waterlogging shows an increasing trend. Since rainfall intensity is
expected to increase under climate change, this could further compound
the impacts of land use changes and place even greater pressure on the
existing storm sewer system.},

 abstract = {The climatology of summer heavy rainfall events over the Beijing
metropolitan region during 2008-2012 is investigated with the aid of an
observational network of rain gauges and the Weather Research and
Forecasting model. Two hot spots of higher frequency of summer heavy
rainfall events are observed. One is located over the urban core region
and the other resides in the climatological downwind region. Two
comparative sets of model runs are designed to assess the effect of land
surface properties with and without the presence of the city on the
model simulation results. By comparing the two sets of model runs, the
changes of rainfall statistics, behaviors of storm cells, and variables
related to convection due to urbanization are analyzed and quantified.
The intensity of heavy rainfall is increased over the urban and downwind
region, corresponding to the locations of the two observed hot spots
based on rain gauges. The changes of rainfall statistics suggest that
the probability distribution of rainfall is shifted toward a heavier
upper tail distribution. The Lagrangian properties of storm cells are
examined using a newly developed Storm-Cell Identification procedure.
High-echo storm cells tend to split approaching the city and merge in
the downwind region. The level of free convection and the height of the
planetary boundary layer are significantly increased over the urban
region and maximum convective available potential energy is decreased.
Increased sensible heat flux from the urban surfaces plays a dominant
role in the modification of simulated rainfall from a climatological
perspective.},

unprecedented rate of growth over the last 30years. Here we take up an
observational study to understand the influence of urbanization on the
characteristics of precipitation (specifically extremes) in India. We
identify 42 urban regions and compare their extreme rainfall

Zonal analysis reveals significant impacts of urbanization on extreme

examination, to understand the influences of urbanization on heavy
rainfall climatology, is carried with station level data using a
statistical method, quantile regression. This is performed for the most
populated city of India, Mumbai, in pair with a nearby nonurban area,
Alibaug; both having similar geographic location. The derived extreme
rainfall regression quantiles reveal the sensitivity of extreme rainfall
events to the increased urbanization. Overall the study identifies the
climatological zones in India, where increased urbanization affects
regional rainfall pattern and extremes, with a detailed case study of
Mumbai. This also calls attention to the need of further experimental

complicit in informal urbanization through their involvement in the
politics of land management in flood prone zones; and second, being
absent through their inaction in informal growth in flood-risk areas. To
each of these positions of the urban state, there are emerging responses
from residents and other non-state actors operating within and outside

associated damages regularly. Understanding the degree of vulnerability
and risk are essential to work out risk reduction measures. It is
equally important to measure the risk perception visa-vis actual risk
for successful implementation of preparedness initiatives. The main
purpose of this paper is to understand the variation as well as the
relationship between actual and perceived risk. Three cities
(Rawalpindi, Sialkot and Muzaffargarh) with different population size
situated in high risk flood zones of Pakistan were selected for
empirical investigation. Household survey was conducted in three urban
communities highly impacted by flood for actual and perceived risk
assessments with well-defined indicators. Results revealed that due to
poor socioeconomic conditions of households living in flood prone
community of metropolitan city, they were more vulnerable as compared to
other cities. In three cities, about 14\% households live at high risk
against 10\% households with high -perceived risk. Significantly
differential risks exist among the cities. Similar results have been
observed in terms of perceived risk. Comparative analyses have revealed
that both actual and perceived risk levels are significantly different
among the cities but reflect a positive correlation in all three cities.
This implies that the perceived risk increases with respect to actual
risk. In the absence of hard data for actual risk assessment, perceived
risk may be a good substitute for working out risk reduction measures.},

intended to improve the capabilities of predicting high-impact weather
events. Within its framework, the aim of the first special observation
period (SOP1), 5 September to 6 November 2012, was to study heavy
precipitation events and flash floods. Here, we present high-impact
weather events over Croatia that occurred during SOP1. Particular
attention is given to eight intense observation periods (IOPs), during
which high precipitation occurred over the eastern Adriatic and Dinaric
Alps. During the entire SOP1, the operational model forecasts generally
well represented medium intensity precipitation, but heavy precipitation
was frequently underestimated by the ALADIN model at an 8 km grid
spacing and was overestimated at a higher resolution (2 km grid
spacing). During IOP2, intensive rainfall occurred over a wider area
around the city of Rijeka in the northern Adriatic. The short-range
maximum rainfall totals were the largest ever recorded at the Rijeka
station since the beginning of measurements in 1958. The rainfall
amounts measured in intervals of 20, 30 and 40 min were exceptional,
with return periods that exceeded a thousand, a few hundred and one
hundred years, respectively. The operational precipitation forecast
using the ALADIN model at an 8 km grid spacing provided guidance
regarding the event but underestimated the rainfall intensity. An
evaluation of numerical sensitivity experiments suggested that the
forecast was slightly enhanced by improving the initial conditions
through variational data assimilation. The operational non-hydrostatic
run at a 2 km grid spacing using a configuration with the ALARO physics
package further improved the forecast. This article highlights the need
for an intensive observation period in the future over the Adriatic
region to validate the simulated mechanisms and improve numerical
weather predictions via data assimilation and model improvements in
descriptions of microphysics and air-sea interactions.},

 abstract = {` Urban development leads to changes of surface cover that disrupt the
hydrological cycle in cities. In particular, impermeable surfaces and
the removal of vegetation reduce the ability to intercept, store and
infiltrate rainwater. Consequently, the volume of stormwater runoff and
the risk of local flooding rises. This is further amplified by the
anticipated effects of climate change leading to an increased frequency
and intensity of heavy rain events. Hence, urban adaptation strategies
are required to mitigate those impacts. A nature-based solution, more
and more promoted in politics and academia, is urban green
infrastructure as it contributes to the resilience of urban ecosystems
by providing services to maintain or restore hydrological functions.
However, this poses a challenge to urban planners in deciding upon
effective adaptation measures as they often lack information on the
performance of green infrastructure to moderate surface runoff. It
remains unclear what type of green infrastructure (e.g. trees, green
roofs), offers the highest potential to reduce discharge volumes and to
what extent. Against this background, this study provides an approach to
gather quantitative evidence on green infrastructure's regulation
potential. We use a micro-scale scenario modelling approach of different
variations of green cover under current and future climatic conditions.
The scenarios are modelled with MIKE SHE, an integrated hydrological
simulation tool, and applied to a high density residential area of
perimeter blocks in Munich, Germany. The results reveal that both trees
and green roofs increase water storage capacities and hence reduce
surface runoff, although the main contribution of trees lies in
increasing interception and evapotranspiration, whereas green roofs
allow for more retention through water storage in their substrate. With
increasing precipitation intensities as projected under climate change
their regulating potential decreases due to limited water storage
capacities. The performance of both types stays limited to a maximum
reduction of 2.4\% compared to the baseline scenario, unless the
coverage of vegetation and permeable surfaces is significantly increased
as a 14.8\% reduction is achieved by greening all roof surfaces. We
conclude that the study provides empirical support for the effectiveness
of urban green infrastructure as nature-based solution to stormwater
regulation and assists planners and operators of sewage systems in
selecting the most effective measures for implementation and estimation
of their effects.},

investigate the sensitivity of extreme daily precipitation and
streamflow to changes in daily temperature. We find little evidence to
suggest that increases in heavy rainfall events at higher temperatures
result in similar increases in streamflow, with most regions throughout
the world showing decreased streamflow with higher temperatures. To
understand why this is the case, we assess the impact of the size of the
catchment and the rarity of the event. As the precipitation event
becomes more extreme and the catchment size becomes smaller,
characteristics such as the initial moisture in the catchment become
less relevant, leading to a more consistent response of precipitation
and streamflow extremes to temperature increase. Our results indicate
that only in the most extreme cases, for smaller catchments, do
increases in precipitation at higher temperatures correspond to
increases in streamflow.},

 abstract = {Urban flood risks are often determined by the frequency analysis of
observed rainfall data, communicated using isohyetal maps showing
rainfall totals for a range of durations and recurrence intervals.
However, to assess future changes in heavy rainfall, it is necessary to
study the future projected rainfall time series. Impacts of climate
change are typically assessed using climate projections based on global
climate model (GCM) outputs and downscaled to finer temporal and spatial
scales. The projected data, however, are not generated in a format that
urban planners and engineers can easily use to design for future
conditions. This research presents a method to analyze and express
climate data in a format that can be readily used in hydrologic models
to assess the effects of future extreme rainfall events. Future
conditions' climate data were analyzed using a weighted ensemble
approach, which resulted in projected rainfall frequency estimates and
their confidence limits. Two multimodel data sets were selected to
illustrate this approach in Cook County, Illinois, which belongs to the
Chicago metropolitan area. The first data set included statistical
downscaling data based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate
Change's (IPCC) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3)
data. The weighted ensemble analysis applied to this data set produced
results that indicated significant increases in projected heavy
rainfall. For example, for CMIP3 Scenario A2, for the late 21st century,
the 100-year, 24-h rainfall in the northern parts of the county was 29\%
larger than the model-generated rainfall for the present time. For the
same time horizon and scenario, the confidence interval based on
projected data was 87\% wider compared with that of the published source
(NOAA Atlas 14), calculated using the past observed data. Also,
equal-weight delta-corrected IPCC CMIP5-based dynamical downscaling data
were applied to the same region for the mid-21st century, producing
increases in heavy rainfall fairly similar to those of CMIP3.},

 abstract = {Purpose - Cities across the globe, particularly those of the less
developed world, face long-term challenges associated with floods which
impact negatively on the resilience of city systems and their
inhabitants. In the city of Maroua, most urban management stakeholders
have been unable to integrate flood resilience research into urban
development issues. It is against this background that the purpose of
this paper is to evaluate the governance issues constraining the
deployment of flood resilience strategies implemented by residents in
flood-prone zones and those used by the government via administrative
authorities and institutions charged with urban development to
flood-related risks in the city of Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon.
Design/methodology/approach - Field surveys, participant observations,
interviews, and on-the-spot appraisals were carried out with residents
in flood-prone neighbourhoods and municipal authorities on the state of
recurrent floods including mitigating strategies being implemented.
Findings - The results revealed that Maroua has a fragile ecological
setting which has increased the vulnerability of the town to
flood-related risks. This is further aggravated by the fact that
municipal authorities are yet to have a thorough mastery of such
recurrent flood incidences due to their limited planning horizons,
rendering the urban poor disproportionately susceptible to flood-related
stresses. This exposes them to unavoidable flood associated hazards such
as water borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) as they are bogged down by
physical and financial limitations. Besides, decision-making processes
in relation to managing urban systems are not guided by good governance
as efforts to enhance and integrate the local population for flood
resilience are neither participatory nor inclusive, ushering the urban
environment of Maroua into a frivolous path to profligacy.
Originality/value - For resilience to be deeply entrenched, the paper
proffers for the mainstreaming of flood resilience strategies into urban
development plans through multi-stakeholder involvement across different
sectors and departments, as well as the setting up of a practical time
table for monitoring the progress of these measures through geospatial
technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information
systems.},

 abstract = {Flood and flood-related problems have become more rampant all over the
world leading to loss of life, infrastructure damage, and epidemics
every year. There are evidences in recent years where heavy
precipitation events have resulted in severe detrimental floods in
India. A number of major cities in India have reported a series of
devastating floods in the recent decade. The immediate impact of floods
specifically in urban areas is on the transport system. Most of the
studies on transport vulnerability consider topographic properties along
with supply and demand side of transport system to access the
disruption; but less attention is given to the potential impacts of
weather extremes on the performance of transportation network. In
response to that, this study aims to provide a framework to assess the
vulnerability of urban road network due to floods. An integrated
framework linking meteorological information, land use functions, and
hydrodynamic model with safety speed function is used to relate flood
depth to reduction in speed in order to determine road network
vulnerability. Two rainfall events with 1-in-10 year and 1-in-100 year
return period were simulated for inundation mapping over road network
and spatial vulnerability of road network was assessed. A critical map
and index is developed to identify affected road length vulnerable to
flood. It has been observed that more than 40\% of road length across
the network becomes immovable for 1-in-100 year rainfall event. Also,
there is a significant decrease in average maximum speed in each road
category corresponding to its normal.},

 abstract = {During the intensive observation period (IOP) of the Tokyo Metropolitan
Area Convection Study for Extreme Weather Resilient Cities (TOMACS) in
the summer months of 2011-2013, the atmospheric environment of several
heavy rainfalls was observed by radiosonde soundings in the Tokyo
metropolitan area. We investigated the formation and development
processes of an extremely developed thunderstorm (Case 1 on August 26,
2011) and a moderately developed thunderstorm (Case 2 on July 18, 2013)
during the TOMACS IOP by utilizing radiosonde sounding data. Compared
with Case 2, Case 1 featured a lower level of free convection and a
deeper layer of easterly flow in the mesoscale environment of the severe
storm. We performed numerical simulations to investigate the formation
processes of the convective systems in the two cases by using the
nonhydrostatic model of the Japan Meteorological Agency incorporating
the square prism urban canopy scheme. Model results fairly represented
the spatial distribution and amounts of the rainfall in both cases. In
Case 1, the formation of a distinct convergence zone between easterly
and southerly flows was the likely trigger of active convective systems
around Tokyo. To further examine the urban impact on precipitation, we
performed two comparative simulations: one using realistic current urban
surface conditions (CRNT experiment) and the other using less-urbanized
surface conditions (LURB experiment). The CRNT experiment yielded more
rainfall than the LURB experiment in the central urban area. It appears
that the higher temperatures caused by urbanization can lead to
increased rainfall in Tokyo by intensifying convergence and ascending
motion.},

perceptions? The present study represents a unique effort to understand
perceptions of flood hazards in light of the geographic background.
Situated in Alabama, the United States, the cities of Mobile and
Huntsville display two different physical geographic contexts. Despite
one being a coastal city (Mobile) and the other being an inland city,
both are similarly vulnerable to flooding. We first present results of
historical analyses of heavy precipitation in both cities and analysis
of storm surge history in the city of Mobile. We then report results of
both descriptive statistical and inferential statistical analyses based
on a two-city residents' survey that was conducted in the spring of
2016. We find that residents in both cities are able to connect the
particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments.
Residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of
precipitation when making assessments of flooding. Despite the fact that
Huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as
Mobile in recent history, residents of Huntsville tend to link heavy
rainfall - the most frequent cause of flooding in that city, with
flooding. In contrast, residents of Mobile tend to link hurricanes, more
particularly hurricane number, with flooding. These results show that
people are attuned to their physical environments and take into
consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of
natural hazards. More studies need to be conducted to further
investigate the dynamics of physical exposure to hazards and risk
perceptions in other geographic areas.},

 abstract = {Climate shock-related water insecurity has a significant impact on
poverty, and vice versa, with poor people adversely impacted by
different hazards. Many studies have focused on rural communities
resulting in a lack of evidence on the vulnerability of urban dwellers.
In this review, we explore the literature on the vulnerability of the
urban poor to floods, droughts, and cholera in Sub-Saharan Africa. We
particularly highlight the structural challenges and systemic
inequalities that are increasing the vulnerability of the urban poor
including the differential experiences of women and children. We
conclude that poor people have: unequal opportunities to cope with
shocks, being deprived from access to water services that wealthier
households have; their needs are inequitably ignored; and cumulative
vulnerability that reverberates climate shocks into smaller consequences
that can have dramatic effects. Therefore, the pathways out of poverty
are limited for the urban poor. This is not only due to factors of
political economy such as the location and construction materials of
houses, but also legacies of discrimination and their reproduction.
Individual vulnerabilities are frequently increased due to the roles and
responsibilities assigned to people of particular genders and/or ages.
We find that these differential vulnerabilities are crucial yet poorly
researched. There is also a lack of evidence for the manifold effects of
drought on the urban poor. Building on the urban climate resilience
literature we argue that policy makers and practitioners must consider
who water security is for. This article is categorized under: Human

using cities as complex systems theory, and Agbogbloshie and Old Fadama

been ineffective due to city planning authorities(3) and state agencies'

Limited resources will be in ever greater demand and the environmental
stress from prolonged droughts, record-breaking heat waves, and
destructive floods will increase. Existing long-term trends and
behaviors will not be sustainable. That is our current trajectory, but
we can still change course. Significant advances in information
communication technologies and big data, combined with new frameworks
for thinking about urban places as social-ecological-technical systems,
and an increasing movement towards transdisciplinary scholarship and
practice sets the foundation and framework for a metropolitan
observatory. Yet, more is required than an infrastructure for data.
Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable will require
that data become actionable knowledge that change policy and practice.
Research and development of urban sustainability and resilience
knowledge is burgeoning, yet the uptake to policy has been slow. An
integrative and holistic approach is necessary to develop effective
sustainability science that synthesizes different sources of knowledge,
relevant disciplines, multi-sectoral alliances, and connections to
policy-makers and the public. To address these challenges and
opportunities, we developed a conceptual framework for a metropolitan

 abstract = {The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to
global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads
and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the
probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of
urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are
crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However,
uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response
centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in
terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police
stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and
residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were
considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in
Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an
optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on
a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model
for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban
areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer
perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the
MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer
attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were
weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone
areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from
meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the
current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model
to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at
risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models
were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and
multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and
their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable
inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results
showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not
covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can
conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that
vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the
nearest ERC.},

 abstract = {In urban areas, the presence of impervious surfaces limits natural
drainage and routes water to stormwater infrastructure with finite
capacity, making these areas especially prone to flooding. Though large
floods are responsible for endangering lives and causing extensive
damage, there is growing evidence that more frequent floods with shallow
water depths, termed nuisance flooding, can have a high cumulative cost
and many direct and indirect damages. To determine whether locations of
nuisance flooding may be linked to topography, we took a parsimonious,
spatially distributed approach to explore whether high topographic index
values co-occur with citizen-reported nuisance flooding. We obtained
nuisance flood reports from the municipal data service 311 for several
watersheds in New York City and Baltimore, USA. Our analysis tested two
topographic indices (TI)-topographic wetness index (TWI) and sink
depth-both calculated from high-resolution (similar to 1 m) digital
elevation models. Generally, our findings suggest that not all but many
locations of reported flooding tend to coincide with deep sinks or large
TWI. However, nuisance flooding reports most commonly coincided with
deep sinks and high TWI when using a maximum, instead of coincident, TI
value extracted around each reported location of flooding, an approach
we used due to the uncertainty in location accuracy of flooding reports.
Overall, our results show promise for application of topographic
indices, typically applied in more natural settings, as indicators of
nuisance flooding areas in urbanized environments. Although limitations
to this approach exist, the application of TIs and crowd-sourced
reporting in tandem could provide a useful starting point for mapping
flood-prone areas in many cities with technologically adept community
members and ample geospatial data.},

severity of flooding is greatly exacerbated. Current methods for
understanding flood risk and mapping floodplains normally does not
clearly communicate either the individual or combined impact of these
two flooding mechanisms. Flood mitigation strategies typically target
either rainfall-driven flooding (e.g., stormwater controls) or
tidally-driven flooding (e.g., flood walls and tide gates). Thus, better
understanding and communicating the individual and combined flood risk
resulting from these two mechanisms can be important to improving flood
resilience. To address this need, this study presents tools and methods
for floodplain mapping in coastal urban environments were rainfall and
storm tide driven flooding can be better understood and communicated.
The approaches are demonstrated for a watershed in Norfolk, VA, USA as a
case study system using a 1D pipe/2D overland flow hydrodynamic model
built for the watershed. Storm tide and heavy rainfall events with
return periods varying from 1 to 100-year were designed based on
historical observations and combined into a series of compound storm
scenarios. Then these compound storm scenarios were simulated using the
hydrodynamic model for simulating flow through both the land surface and
underground pipe network systems. Results show how the capacity of the
drainage system, and therefore flood risk reduction, is sensitive to
storm tide levels, even for less extreme events with a 1-year return
period. The model also provides new insights into the role of stormwater
infrastructure in exacerbating flooding risk within communities during
high sea level conditions. Results demonstrate how dividing the
floodplain into different regions based on the dominant flooding
mechanism (rainfall vs. storm tide) makes it possible to better target
mitigation strategies to improve flood resilience. To this end, a
transition zone index (TZI) is presented to help decision makers
identify the change from rainfall-driven to tide-driven flooding for
locations within a watershed. Finally, we demonstrate how different
flood mitigation strategies can be tested using this modeling approach
to better understand their impact on increasing flood resilience within
the system for portions of the floodplain impacted by rainfall-driven
and tidal-driven flooding.},

analysis on a 10-year hourly precipitation dataset combined with the
fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric hourly reanalysis (ERA-5) and
half-hourly FengYun-2 geostationary satellite observations during the
pre-summer rainy season from 2008 to 2017. Results showed that hourly
extreme rainfall events over the PRDMR increased at a significant pace
during the most recent 10 years, which frequently occurred during the
early morning (0400-0900 local standard time {[}LST; UTC + 8 hr]) and
afternoon (1300-1800 LST) over the central urban district and 100-km
downstream area. Comparative analysis of the meteorological conditions
between the two peak periods revealed that the hourly extreme rainfall
events over the PRDMR during the pre-summer rainy season were overall
prefrontal rainstorms that occurred under the influence of dominant
south-westerlies and weak easterly backflows of warm-moist air at lower
atmospheres. The hot plumes rooted at the urban surface may be the key
local environmental factors responsible for generating hourly heavy
rainfall over the PRDMR. Given favourable large-scale conditions, the
interaction of urban heat island effects with sea breezes and
mountain-valley breezes can promote convection by altering the
thermodynamic and dynamic structures around the PRDMR. By comparison,
the hourly extreme rainfall events that occurred during morning periods
over the PRDMR were more sensitive to moderate to strong wind shear at
the lower planetary boundary layer, whereas those that occurred during
afternoon periods were more likely to occur in the presence of an
environment with high conditional instability.},

urban canopy model (BEP) was employed to assess the impact of
urbanization on three rainfall processes of different strengths in
Beijing. Based on the satisfactory model simulation performance,
sensitivity tests based on a land use map without an urban component
were performed to analyze the observed characteristics and the
mechanisms underlying the influence of urbanization on rainfall of
different strengths. The results showed that urbanization has the most
significant influence on heavy rain among the three rainfall cases with
different precipitation strengths and that urbanization obviously
increased the amount of precipitation in urban areas and upwind and
downwind suburban areas. At the edge of the city, moderate rainfall was
also increased by urbanization. However, urbanization had almost no
effect on light rainfall. A possible mechanism underlying the
urbanization-induced change in precipitation is proposed. Urbanization
results in changes in land use and increases in anthropogenic heat via
changes in the energy balance of the surface, creating urban heat
islands (UHIs). Consequently, cyclonic activity is more easily generated
upwind and downwind of the urban area. When the moisture is sufficiently
high, such as in cases of heavy or moderate rainfall, moisture flux
convergence is more likely to develop in urban areas and the upwind and
downwind areas. The rainfall system is enhanced in these areas as a
result of the increase in the potential energy in the system.},

 abstract = {Background Climate change is increasing the number and intensity of
extreme weather events in many parts of the world. Precipitation
extremes have been linked to both outbreaks and sporadic cases of
waterborne illness. We have previously shown a link between heavy rain
and turbidity to population-level risk of sporadic cryptosporidiosis and
giardiasis in a major Canadian urban population. The risk increased with
30 or more dry days in the 60 days preceding the week of extreme rain.
The goal of this study was to investigate the change in
cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis risk due to climate change, primarily
change in extreme precipitation. Methods Cases of cryptosporidiosis and
giardiasis were extracted from a reportable disease system (1997-2009).
We used distributed lag non-linear Poisson regression models and
projections of the exposure-outcome relationship to estimate future
illness (2020-2099). The climate projections are derived from twelve
statistically downscaled regional climate models. Relative Concentration
Pathway 8.5 was used to project precipitation derived from daily gridded
weather observation data (similar to 6 x 10 km resolution) covering the
central of three adjacent watersheds serving metropolitan Vancouver for
the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s and 2080s. Results Precipitation is predicted to
steadily increase in these watersheds during the wet season (Oct. -Mar.)
and decrease in other parts of the year up through the 2080s. More weeks
with extreme rain (>90th percentile) are expected. These weeks are
predicted to increase the annual rates of cryptosporidiosis and
giardiasis by approximately 16\% by the 2080s corresponding to an
increase of 55-136 additional cases per year depending upon the climate
model used. The predicted increase in the number of waterborne illness
cases are during the wet months. The range in future projections
compared to historical monthly case counts typically differed by 10-20\%
across climate models but the direction of change was consistent for all
models. Discussion If new water filtration measures had not been
implemented in our study area in 2010-2015, the risk of
cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis would have been expected to increase
with climate change, particularly precipitation changes. In addition to
the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme
precipitation events, the frequency and length of wet and dry spells
could also affect the risk of waterborne diseases as we observed in the
historical period. These findings add to the growing evidence regarding
the need to prepare water systems to manage and become resilient to
climate change-related health risks.},

hazards that trigger natural disasters, such as flash floods,

rainy-season rainfall during the last seven decades. While there were
practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s,
these days have been occurring two to five times a year in the last 10
years. This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas,
such as slopes and banks of watercourses, leads to inundation, flooding,
and landslides. Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate
variability but can also be related to global warming and/or
urbanization. There is ample evidence of an increasing risk of
rainfall-related hazards in the MASP. This is particularly so for
landslides in vulnerable areas. Exposure will continue to lead to risk
increases. This calls for significant improvement in climate and

the Flood Foresight project in 2002-2004 and 2008; envisaging flood risk

updates these drivers, using empirical evidence and advances in flood
risk science, technology and practice gained since 2008. Of the original
drivers, five have strengthened, three have weakened and 14 remain
within their 2008 uncertainty bands. Rainfall, as impacted by climate
change, is the leading source driver of future urban flood risk.
Intra-urban asset deterioration, leading to increases in a range of
consequential flood risks, is the primary pathway driver. Social impacts
(risk to life and health, and the intangible impacts of flooding on
communities) and continued capital investment in buildings and contents
(leading to greater losses when newer buildings of higher economic worth
are inundated) have strengthened as receptor drivers of urban flood
risk. Further, we propose two new drivers: loss of floodable urban
spaces and indirect economic impacts, which we suggest may have
significant impacts on future urban flood risk.

East Asian metropolitan areas due to fast urban development and changes
in climate, threatening people's property and life. Typically, flood
management actions are mostly focused on large-scale defences, such as
river embankments or discharge channels or tunnels. However, these are
difficult to implement in town centres without affecting the value of
their heritage districts and might not provide sufficient mitigation.
Therefore, urban heritage buildings may become vulnerable to flood
events, even when they were originally designed and built with intrinsic
resilient measures, based on the local knowledge of the natural
environment and its threats at the time. Their aesthetic and cultural
and economic values mean that they can represent a proportionally high
contribution to losses in any event. Hence it is worth investigating
more localized, tailored mitigation measures. Vulnerability assessment
studies are essential to inform the feasibility and development of such
strategies. In this study we propose a multilevel methodology to assess
the flood vulnerability and risk of residential buildings in an area of
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, characterized by traditional timber housing. The
multiscale flood vulnerability model is based on a wide range of
parameters, covering building-specific parameters, neighbourhood
conditions and catchment area conditions. The obtained vulnerability
index shows the ability to reflect different exposure by different
building types and their relative locations. The vulnerability model is
combined with high-resolution fluvial and pluvial flood maps providing
scenario events with 0.1 \% annual exceedance probability (AEP). A
damage function of generic applicability is developed to compute the
economic losses at individual building and sample levels. The study
provides evidence that results obtained for a small district can be
scaled up to the city level, to inform both generic and specific
protection strategies.},

could enhance flooding. Furthermore, we combined both analyses to
identify flood risk situations in the region. Our results indicated that
maximum precipitation and hydrometric values remained stable during the
study period, with a marked interannual variability due to the presence
of dry and wet phases. During the dry phase (2011-2015), when flooding
events were infrequent, there was a steady urban sprawl in the
floodplain area and, as a result, more people would have subsequently
become exposed to flood risk. Our results evidence the lack of regional
policies to regulate the urban sprawl in flood risk regions.},

a set of methods compiled into an integrated system by the Department of
Hydraulic Engineering of University of Sao Paulo (USP). We observed
that, for relatively frequent flood events with 10y of return periods,
changes in LULC represent an increase of maximum water depths that vary
up to 0,036 m to 0,043 m, respectively. For less frequent events, with
return periods of 100y, the maximum increase of water depth varies from
0,064 m to 0,071 m. Although the water depth reached is not considered
risky (e.g., for an adult walking in flows), the water velocity (v =
2,32 m/s) and the amount of water downhill (similar to 5,000 litters)
are considered high (i.e. pedestrians can be swept along streets during
major storm events). Our scenarios project more than 5,000 people

 abstract = {Extreme flood events can lead to dramatic changes in societal processes,
disrupt rural-urban linkages and affect rural vulnerabilities. Changes
in rural-urban linkages due to extreme flooding have been theoretically
discussed with limited empirical evidence. Therefore, this study
investigates the impacts of a flood event on linkages between rural and
urban areas of Pakistan. This study also examines socioeconomic and
spatial factors that can influence changes in rural-urban linkages.
Three case studies were selected from the Punjab province of Pakistan,
and a total of 325 samples were collected through household surveys.
Descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression and correlation
analysis were conducted to analyse the data. The findings show that
flooding has severely affected rural communities directly and
indirectly. This paper details the many different ways in which floods
can change rural linkages with cities-i.e., the flow of people,
information, finance, goods and services between rural and urban areas.
The results also reveal that the age of household head, education,
income and farming occupation are influential factors that affect how
rural-urban linkages change. Most importantly, the research highlights
that extreme flooding can both increase and decrease the dependence of
rural communities on cities in different ways. This indicates that
linkages between rural and urban areas need to be strengthened in order
to reduce flood-related vulnerabilities. This study paves the way for
regional planners and disaster managers to establish synergies for
developing integrated flood risk management and development strategies.

 abstract = {Urban pluvial flooding has become a common threat for urban areas.
Intensified rainfall, increasing imperviousness, and insufficient
drainage capacity contribute to the increase of pluvial flood risk. The
strategy of risk mitigation relies on the understanding of these
controlling factors of urban pluvial flooding. However, spatial
heterogeneity of the impacts of controlling factors has received limited
attention. This study analyzes how topography, rainfall, impervious
surfaces affect urban pluvial flooding and how the effects vary in
space. A case study in the city of Cincinnati, US based on four storm
events in recent years is conducted. The impact of topography is
measured by a depression-based empirical parameter, Topographic Control
Index (TCI), which is generated based on depression ponding volume,
contributing area, and upstream slope. Rainfall depth estimated from
kriging interpolation method is used to measure how the rainfall affect
the urban pluvial flooding. The impervious area ratio of the
contributing area of each depression as well as that of observed flooded
locations are calculated to analyze the influence of impervious area.
The results showed that TCI value and rainfall intensity are spatially
correlated with the presence of flooded locations, and flooded locations
can be classified into two types: rainfall control or topography
control. The imperviousness of land surface does not show a significant
correlation with pluvial flood due to the relatively small spatial
variation of impervious area in a well-developed city. The framework in
this study could identify the spatial distribution of dominant
controlling factors for pluvial flooding, which is critical for the
effective planning of mitigation measures.},

severe damages in locations with denser infrastructures, such as DC. The
multi-scale comparison suggested that block scale analysis is more
sensitive to vulnerability and flood damages compared to coarser scales,

significantly dependent on both the type of the compound flood event and
the scale of the analysis. From a flood management perspective, coarser

green infrastructure on urban waterlogging largely depends on its area
and biophysical parameter. Healthier or denser vegetation (superior
ecological environment) can more effectively intercept and store
rainwater runoff. This suggests that while increasing the area of UGI,
more attention should be paid to the biophysical parameter of
vegetation. Hence, the mitigation effect of green infrastructure would
be improved from the ``size{''} and ``health{''}. The interaction of
composition and spatial configuration greatly enhances their individual
effects on waterlogging. This result underscores the importance of the
interactive enhancement effect between UGI composition and spatial
configuration. Therefore, it is particularly important to optimize the
UGI composition and spatial pattern under limited land resource
conditions. Lastly, the effect of green infrastructure on waterlogging
presents a threshold phenomenon. The excessive area proportions of UGI
within the watershed unit or an oversized UGI patch may lead to a waste
of its mitigation effect. Therefore, the area proportion of UGI and its
mitigation effect should be considered comprehensively when planning
UGI. It is recommended to control the proportion of green infrastructure
at the watershed scale (24.4\% and 72.1\% for Guangzhou and Shenzhen) as
well as the area of green infrastructure patches (1.9 ha and 2.8 ha for
Guangzhou and Shenzhen) within the threshold level to maximize its
mitigation effect. Given the growing concerns of global warming and
continued rapid urbanization, these findings provide practical urban
waterlogging prevention strategies toward practical implementations.},

 abstract = {It has been recently observed that traditional probability-based design
of urban drainage systems often fails because of frequent heavy rainfall
events due to global climate change. Therefore, it is critical to
consider a system's ability to prepare, react, and recover from a
failure (i.e., resilience) in urban drainage network design. This study
proposes a resilience-constrained optimal design model of urban drainage
networks that minimizes total system cost while satisfying predefined
levels of failure depth and duration. Failure (e.g., flooding) depth
refers to the level of system performance degradation, whereas failure
duration is the time taken for a system's recovery to its normal state.
Optimal layout and pipe sizes are identified by the proposed model
comprising the harmony search algorithm for optimization and the storm
water management model (SWMM) for dynamic hydrology-hydraulic
simulations. The proposed model is demonstrated through the design of
two grid networks and an A-city drainage network. The obtained
resilience-based design is compared to the least-cost design obtained
with no resilience consideration according to optimized layout and pipe
sizes and the resulting topological characteristics.},

events with strong urban heat island (UHI) effects over the Great Bay
Area (GBA) in South China during the 2011-16 warm seasons.
Quasi-idealized, convection-permitting ensemble simulations driven by
diurnally varying lateral boundary conditions, which are extracted from
the composite global analysis of 3-5 June 2013, are then conducted with
a multilayer urban canopy model to unravel the influences of the UHI and
various surface properties nearby on the EXHR generation in a complex
geographical environment with sea-land contrast, topography, and
vegetation variation. Results show that EXHR is mostly distributed over
the urban agglomeration and within about 40 km on its downwind side, and
produced during the afternoon-to-evening hours by short-lived
meso-gamma- to meso-beta-scale storms. On the EXHR days, the GBA is
featured by a weak gradient environment with abundant moisture, and a
weak southwesterly flow prevailing in the boundary layer (BL). The UHI
effects lead to the development of a deep mixed layer with ``warm
bubbles{''} over the urban agglomeration, in which the lower-BL
convergence and BL-top divergence is developed, assisting in convective
initiation. Such urban BL processes and associated convective
development with moisture supply by the synoptic low-level southwesterly
flow are enhanced by orographically increased horizontal winds and sea
breezes under the influence of the herringbone coastline, thereby
increasing the inhomogeneity and intensity of rainfall production over
the ``pi-shaped{''} urban clusters. Vegetation variations are not found
to be an important factor in determining the EXHR production over the

faster rates and with an opposite trend to that reported by the global

suffer more house collapses than rural towns and cities. House
consolidation is quicker than the settlement expansion but this is not
sufficient to reduce damage from pluvial flooding. The proportion of the

for urban planning into a radical driver of urban development. In
addition to fundamental changes in urban planning to increase long-term
resilience, the creation of new opportunities for sustainable
transformation is imperative. While urban planners increasingly add
climate risks to their menu, implementation of effective action is
lagging. To reduce urban infrastructure's vulnerability to heat and
flooding, cities often rely on short-term incremental adjustments rather
than considering longer-term transformative solutions. The
transdisciplinary co-development of inspiring urban visions with local
stakeholders over timescales of decades or more, can provide an
appealing prospect of the city we desire-a city that is attractive to
live and work in, and simultaneously resilient to climate hazards.
Taking an historic perspective, we argue that re-imagining historical
urban planning concepts, such as the late 19th-century garden city until
early 21st century urban greening through nature-based solutions, is a
pertinent example of how climate risk management can be combined with a
wide-range of socio-economic and environmental goals. Climate knowledge
has expanded rapidly over the last decades. However, climate experts
mainly focus on the refinement of and access to observations and model
results, rather than on translating their knowledge effectively to meet

urban areas has become a worldwide issue and has been the subject of
several studies in recent decades. Climate change projection in the
design phase of urban planning allows building capacity for urban
adaptation and avoids future economic costs. Many coastal communities
still keep reactive adaptation responses due to a lack of knowledge
about how to incorporate this information in planning. In this sense,
this paper presents a modelling framework to guide the incorporation of
climate projections in the planning and management of coastal areas. The
framework was applied in a coastal city of Brazil, where high
environmental vulnerability and constantly coastal flooding are
observed. The results indicate that there is no significant difference
between the emission scenarios, in the short and medium-term, for
precipitation projections and runoff peak flow. Extreme rainfall
projections give differences up to 21\% between the historical series
and the projection for 2100. For the sea level projection, the extent of
flooded areas induced by the worst emission scenario until the end of
the century will reach 10\% of the total municipally area (characterized
by ecologically sensitive areas). In general, the framework provides
preliminary information that can be used to improve spatial planning in
a local context. Given the several simplified assumptions, the results
should be used with caution, serving as a baseline for future planning

addition, the understanding of the impacts of climate change on urban
sanitation systems fails to take acomprehensive citywide perspective
considering interdependencies with other sectors and combinations of
climate effects. Weconclude that the evidence for climate change impacts
on urban sanitation systems is weak. To date, research neither
adequatelyrepresents the variety of urban sanitation infrastructure and
service systems nor reflects the operational and management challenges
of already stressed systems},

 abstract = {Pluvial flooding is a serious hazard in inland U.S. cities. City
managers and communities are increasingly interested in reducing their
pluvial flood risk through the development of green infrastructure (GI)
features. This research explores the relationship between pluvial flood
exposure and GI placement in three inland cities-Atlanta, Phoenix, and
Portland-and analyzes the variation of sociodemographic variables in
census block groups (CBG) located in pluvial flood zones. Using the
Arc-MalstrOm method, we estimated areas of pluvial flooding in the CBGs
of our selected cities by relating pluvial flood area to the density of
GI in CBGs and assigning CBGs one of four classifications: i) managed
(large flood area, abundant GI), ii) prepared (small flood area,
abundant GI), iii) vulnerable (large flood area, scarce GI), and iv)
least concern (small flood area, scarce GI). Then, using the historical
GI data, we examined the proportionality of GI investment over time to
pluvial flood area. We found relationships between GI density, flood
area, ethnic and racial minority populations, age, educational
attainment, and median household incomes that indicated inequalities and
potential discrimination in flood risk management, but also some
evidence of equitable and appropriate management given differences in
flood risk, especially in Phoenix and Portland. In Atlanta, newer GI
installation prioritized white and wealthy neighborhoods where
relatively higher flood risk exists (less equitable). Our classification
framework may assist city flood risk managers to distribute GI more
equitably according to equitability and need.},

 abstract = {The Metropolitan Zone of Mexico City, as well as the associated basin,
includes the territories of Mexico City, some municipalities of the
State of Mexico and the state of Hidalgo. In addition, this area is the
most densely populated in Mexico. The region is influenced by
mid-latitude and tropical weather systems and is vulnerable to extreme
hydrometeorological events. In this context, we developed a dataset from
the records of 136 geolocated sites that includes daily precipitation
data from the CLImate COMputing (CLICOM) project and the Mexico City
Water System. The data spans the period from 1930 to 2015 for the rainy
months (June-October) from stations with records of 20 or more years. In
each recording site, automatic and manual data quality control were
performed to verify the consistency of the daily precipitation data. We
believe that our highly dense precipitation dataset will be useful for
climate, trend and extreme events analysis. Additionally, the data will
allow validating simulations of numerical atmospheric models. The
dataset is public, and it was previously used in other research to
determine areas susceptible to flooding due to heavy rain events and to
develop a web mapping application of daily precipitation data.},
